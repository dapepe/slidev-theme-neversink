<div class="cmsit-card">
  Important information goes here
</div>

<div class="cmsit-button">
  Click Me
</div>
```

## Icons

This theme works with various icon sets. For best compatibility, use the Carbon icon set:

```html
<!-- Use Carbon icons -->
<carbon-logo-linkedin class="text-3xl" />
<carbon-document class="text-3xl" />
```

## Logo Display

This theme will automatically display the company logo in the slide footer. You can control which logo to show by setting the appropriate color scheme:

- Dark backgrounds use the white logo
- Light backgrounds use the green logo

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter dependency issues when running your presentation, try these solutions:

1. **Missing dependencies**: Install with pnpm for better dependency resolution
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Icon errors**: Make sure to use icons from the Carbon set or install additional icon sets:
   ```bash
   pnpm add @iconify-json/mdi
   ```
